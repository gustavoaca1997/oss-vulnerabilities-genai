The results show that the project successfully identifies copied OSS even if it was refactored, however it returns a few false positives when trying to detect if it has vulnerabilities. This might be due to the validation process, which is using AI generated synthetic data. More investigation should be done.\n","\n","## Why use Embedded Models?\n","Embedded models help finding semantically similar source code, where it doesn't matter if the lines of code have been reordered or altered, if the semantic is the same, a good embedding model should capture that. This can help detecting known vulnerabilities from the Open-Source community.\n","\n","## Summary of the steps\n","- Create embeddings using `semantic_similarity` task and store them in ChromaDB's containers, one for vulnerable code and one for safe code.\n","- Take a sample of the source code used and use a generative model for refactoring it. Use the new generated code for validating the project."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"5e7415dd","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-21T07:48:27.228384Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-21T07:48:27.22792Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-21T07:48:29.19147Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-21T07:48:29.190292Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.979324,"end_time":"2025-04-21T07:48:29.192975","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-21T07:48:27.213651","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/kaggle/input/cvefixes-vulnerable-and-fixed-code/CVEFixes.csv\n","/kaggle/input/cvefixes-vulnerable-and-fixed-code/LICENSE.txt\n"]}],"source":["#
